## ReactNative.Directory

The [React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory/) lists libraries and native modules that are available across all of the React Native platforms including iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and more. 

To view which modules are available for a specific platform, you can use the Filters function on the website, or visit these pre-filtered URLs:

- [Modules that support Windows](https://reactnative.directory/?windows=true)
- [Modules that support macOS](https://reactnative.directory/?macos=true)

## Microsoft-supported Modules

The React Native team at Microsoft has worked together with the community to add Windows and macOS support to several community modules. The modules that Microsoft has added support for are listed below. 

The following modules have been ejected as part of the React Native [Lean Core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313) effort:

| Name | Version Supported (Windows) | Version Supported (macOS) |
|:-|:-|:-|
| <ins>[async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage)</ins> | 0.61 | |
| <ins>[react-native-webview](https://www.github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview)</ins> | 0.61 | |
| <ins>[react-native-netinfo](https://www.github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo)</ins> | 0.61 | |
| <ins>[react-native-picker](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-picker)</ins> | 0.61 | |
| <ins>[react-native-progress-view](https://github.com/react-native-community/progress-view)</ins> | 0.62 | |
| <ins>[datetimepicker](https://github.com/react-native-community/datetimepicker)</ins> | 0.62 | |

In addition to the ejected modules above, Microsoft has also added support for a set of popular and highly requested community modules:

| Name | Version Supported (Windows) | Version Supported (macOS) |

| <ins>[react-native-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation)</ins> | 0.62 | |
| <ins>[react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated)</ins> | 0.62[*](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues/4151) | |
| <ins>[react-native-video](https://www.github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video)</ins> | 0.61 | |
| <ins>[react-native-linear-gradient](https://www.github.com/react-native-community/react-native-linear-gradient)</ins> | 0.61 | |

The React Native team at Microsoft is continually adding support for community modules. Visit the [Community Modules support project board](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/projects/23) to see which modules will be supported next.

## Help! A module I need doesn't support Windows and/or macOS!

If you need a module that doesn't currently support Windows and/or macOS, please [submit a support request](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues/new/choose) and let us know.

Additionally, you can also file an issue on the module repository to let them know that you need Windows and/or macOS support. If you file an additional issue in the module repository, please be sure to link it to the issue in the React Native Windows repo to help us track.
