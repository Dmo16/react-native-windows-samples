## Supported Community Modules
We are in the process of ejecting the components and modules that are not part of React Native [Lean Core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/23313) into their respective [community repos](https://github.com/react-native-community).

The following have been migrated out:

| Name | Version Supported | 
|:-|:-|
| <ins>[async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-community/async-storage)</ins> | 0.61 |
| <ins>[react-native-webview](https://www.github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview)</ins> | 0.61 |
| <ins>[react-native-netinfo](https://www.github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo)</ins> | 0.61 |
| <ins>[react-native-picker](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-picker)</ins> | 0.61 |
| <ins>[datetimepicker](https://github.com/react-native-community/datetimepicker)</ins> | [in progress](https://github.com/react-native-community/datetimepicker/pull/157) |

In addition, we are working on adding Windows support to popular and highly requested community modules. You can keep track on the progress of both these efforts through the [Community Modules support project board](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/projects/23). Here are some modules that React Native for Windows currently supports:

| Name | Version Supported | 
|:-|:-|
| <ins>[react-native-camera](https://www.github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera)</ins> | 0.61 |
| <ins>[react-native-device-info](https://www.github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info)</ins> | 0.61 |
| <ins>[react-native-video](https://www.github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video)</ins> | 0.61 |
| <ins>[react-native-linear-gradient](https://www.github.com/react-native-community/react-native-linear-gradient)</ins> | 0.61 |

If there is an unsupported community module that you donâ€™t see in our roadmap, please [submit a support request](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/issues/new/choose) and let us know.
