# Hermes
The [Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev/) engine is an open source JavaScript engine created by Facebook to optimize building and running React Native applications.

To learn more about what it is and how to use it, check out the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes#docsNav) documentation for it.

## Available on macOS
Hermes is available on React Native for macOS, provided you are using version 0.62 or higher.
To learn how to upgrade to the latest version, check out the **Upgrading** section of the [macOS Getting Started guide](rnm-getting-started.md).

After you have upgraded to the latest version of React Native for macOS, install and add the following:

1.  Install the npm package `yarn add 'hermes-engine-darwin@^0.4.3'`
2. Add (or uncomment) the following pod dependencies to your macOS target in your `Podfile`:<br>
```
pod 'React-Core/Hermes', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-macos/'
pod 'hermes', :path => '../node_modules/hermes-engine-darwin'
pod 'libevent', :podspec => '../node_modules/react-native-macos/third-party-podspecs/libevent.podspec'
```
3. Run `pod install`

> Be sure to set your target's deployment target to at least 10.14 before running `pod install`

# What about Windows?
React Native for Windows does not currently support Hermes, but we're in the process of investigating and testing it internally. We expect to have it working soon!
